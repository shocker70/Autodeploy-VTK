Automated deployment of Ngix server with Terraform. 

This will generate the following network structure

+----- VPC --- I.Gateway -----------+
| 10.0.0.0/16	
| 	 +---Subnet--+	
|	 10.0.1.0/24
|		
|	        +---- ELB----+
|		  [ IP   ]
|		+---- EC2 ---+
|		  [  IP  ]
|
|
|
+----------------------------------+

VPC [ SUBNET [ ELB + EC2 ] ]

At the moment this will include only 1 EC2 instance.


IMPORTANT:
1. To make this work you need to modify   { example_variables.modify } -> { [yourchoice].tfvars}
2. Adjust variables inside to make it work. ( need AWS account /* freetier is enought */ )
